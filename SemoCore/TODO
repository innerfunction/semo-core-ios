1. Add web view (as UIViewController subclass?)
2. Add list view (and supporting classes, migrate from EPCore)
3. Layout code (to IFContainerViewController)
4. Need to review view heirarchy maintenance code - current implementation probably quite flaky in places

Then:
5. New form views go into a new module
6. Semo content also in new module, to include simplified MVC implementation using key/value observing.
