// TODO: There are a number or problems/shortcomings with this circular dependency solution:
// 1. It doesn't work for direct mappings in collections, e.g. { "xxx": "@named:yyy" }. The container
//    configuration cycle could be extended to support this use case, but then the approach probably
//    wouldn't work on Android due to the stricter typing (i.e. on a generically typed collection,
//    although because of type erasure, it might work...)
// 2. Not sure if the approach works for new: and make: URI schemes, due to different configuration
//    cycle. This needs testing.

/**

 * value can't be resolved till after its configuration is complete. This placeholder allows
 * the details of the named dependency to be recorded so that it can be resolved after the
 * configuration cycle has completed.
