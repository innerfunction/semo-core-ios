/**
 * An internal URI handler for the _repr:_ scheme.
 * This scheme allows URI resources to be coerced to a specific representation within a URI.
 * Scheme URIs are in the form:
 *
 *     <scheme name>:<representation name>+value@<uri>
 *
 * That is, each URI should have a _value_ parameter specifying the value to be coerced, and a URI
 * name part that identifies the name of the required representation.
 * This scheme is useful only in very particular cases, e.g. where the default resolved representation
 * isn't what is actually needed.
