/**
 * A concrete implementation of the IOCProxy protocol. The main purpose of this class is to provide
 * a standard method for proxy class registration in IFContainer. Subclasses can invoke the
 * [registerConfigurationProxyClass: forClassName:] class method from their class [load] method;
 * IFContainer will then call the [registerProxyClasses] method on this class.
 * It's not required that configuration proxies extend this class, but implementations which don't
 * will then need to provide their own alternative registration method.
