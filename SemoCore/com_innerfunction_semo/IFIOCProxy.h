/**
 * A protocol which must be implemented by configuration proxies.
 * A configuration proxy is a class for objects which are configured in place of objects of
 * another class. They are useful for providing standardized configuration APIs which are
 * consistent across platforms; or for providing simplified configuration interfaces for
 * otherwise difficult to configure objects.
 * Configuration proxy classes should be registered using the IFContainer
 * _[registerConfigurationProxyClassName: forClassName:]_ method.

 * This method will be called by the container when configuring an in-place value (i.e. a
 * value already on the object instance before dependency injection starts).
 * Support for this method is optional, depending on the particularities of the class being
 * proxied, but in general most proxies should support two modes of operation; (1) where the
 * value being proxied is new, and (2) where the value being proxied is in-place.
