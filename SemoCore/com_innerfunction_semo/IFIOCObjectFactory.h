/**
 * A protocol implemented by objects which act as object factories for the IOC container.
 * Component configurations can nominate an object factory to build the object instead of the container,
 * using the _*factory_ instantiation hint.
 * Note that object factories take full responsibility for creating and building the required component
 * from its configuration, i.e. the container won't perform any dependency injection on the component
 * after its construction has been delegeted to the function.
