/**
 * A configurable version of the _UIViewController_ class.
 * Implements the <IFMessageReceiver> protocol and responds to the following messages:
 * - _toast_: Display an Android style popup message. Must have a _message_ parameter.
 * - _show-image_: Display an image in a pop-over view. Must have an _image_ parameter.
 *
 * This class supports loading of view layouts from XIB files, and configuration of view
 * components contained by such layouts. This can be done in a couple of ways.
 *
 * Method one utilizes the container's ability to perform configuration of in-place
 * property values. To use this method, this class should be subclassed with new properties
 * representing the configurable view components. The properties should be marked using the
 * IBOutlet attribute and then be used as referencing outlets within the XIB. When the
 * new view controller class is instantiated by a container, the layout will be loaded and
 * the view components mapped to their respective properties before the container performs
 * its IOC configuration on the controller instance, at which point it can inject any
 * additional configuration values into the view component properties.
 *
 * The second method involves creating empty views as placeholders within the layout, and
 * mapping these placeholders to named referencing outlets. The actual view instances can
 * then be defined under the _namedViews_ collection property of the controller. After the
 * layout is loaded, the controller will look for placeholders for each of its named views,
 * and replace each placeholder with the named view instance. This can be done for both
 * UIView and UIViewController instances. This second method doesn't necessarily require
 * this class to be subclassed, so long as the referencing outlets are named appropriately
 * in the layout file.
