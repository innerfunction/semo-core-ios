/**
 * A configurable version of the _SWRevealViewController_ class. Can be used for example to display a screen
 * with a menu in a hidden view which slides out from the side.
 *
 * The class implements the _IFMessageReceiver_ protocol and responds to the following messages:
 * - _show_: Show a new view by replacing the view displayed in the screen's main area. The message must have
 * a _view_ parameter.
 * - _show-in-slide_: Show a new view in the slide area. The message must have a _view_ parameter.
 * - _open-slide_: Make the slide view visible.
 * - _close-slide_: Hide the slide view, if visible.
 * - _toggle-slide_: Toggle the slide view's visibility.
 *
 * The class implements the _IFMessageRouter_ protocol and provides the following targets, which
 * messages can be addressed to:
 * - _main_: The main view area.
 * - _slide_: The slide view area.
